I am a molecular biologist who is fascinated with discovering hidden patterns in data. My journey so far in life-science research has taken me full circle – from generating clean data, to analyzing it to extract valuable knowledge. I have solved high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of proteins involved in deadly diseases. I have also leveraged cloud based high-performance computing techniques to analyze high-dimensional data from whole genomes. This enabled the discovery of cryptic population structures in Human parasites. Along the way, I have come to realize that effective knowledge creation involves going back-and-forth between data generation, analysis, and presentation. This is because in the real world they all feed into each other.

This blog, therefore, is my attempt to present the world’s public data in a more effective way. This would, hopefully, make it possible to extract patterns in data which help solve some of the pressing needs of our times.
