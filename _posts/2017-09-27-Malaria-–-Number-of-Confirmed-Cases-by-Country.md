Malaria is a fatal disease that is transmitted by certain types of infected mosquitoes. The parasite that causes it has been around for several thousands of years. In fact, the very first Humans that lived in Africa were already dying from the disease. As the early Humans migrated to new land, they carried Malaria with them. Today, Malaria causes nearly half a million deaths worldwide. We have come a long way since the time of our early ancestors, but have we made any progress in eradicating this fatal disease?
